\title{Power and sample size calculation
}
\description{
Computes power for genotypic TDT, allelic TDT or Score test given n trios or required sample size to gain given power.
}
\usage{
trio.power(p = 0.5, RR = 1.5, alpha = 5*10^(-8), n = NULL, beta = NULL, 
  model = c("additive", "dominant", "recessive"), test = c("gTDT", "Score", "aTDT"))
  
\method{print}{trio.power}(x,digits=4,...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{p}{
a numeric vector of population frequencies of a mutant allele.
}
  \item{RR}{
a numeric vector of the assumed relative risks for an individual getting a disease with 1 (in case of recessive model 2) mutant alleles compared to the risk of individuals carying 0 mutant alleles.
}
  \item{alpha}{
a numeric vector of significance levels (Type I Error probability).
}
  \item{n}{
a numeric vector containing number of trios in a study. Must be filled for power calculation. Must not be NULL for sample size calculation.
}
  \item{beta}{
the desired power of the test. Must be filled for power calculation. Must not be NULL for sample size calculation.
}
  \item{model}{
a character containing the genotypic model assumed. Possible values are \code{"additive"}, \code{"dominant"} and \code{"recessive"}. In case of \code{test="aTDT"},
  the standard multiplicative model will be considered. Abbreviations are allowed. Thus, e.g., \code{model = "dom"} will fit a dominant model,
  and \code{model = "r"} a recessive model.
}
  \item{test}{
the chosen test. Must be \code{"aTDT"}, \code{"gTDT"} or \code{"Score"}. Abbreviations are allowed. Thus, e.g., \code{test = "g"} will perform a 
   genotypic TDT, and \code{test = "S"} a Score test.
}
\item{x}{an object of class \code{trio.power}.}
\item{digits}{number of digits that should be printed.}
\item{...}{ignored}
}
\details{
Power and sample size calculation is derived on Knapp (1999). The power or the sample size will be calculated for all combinations of p, RR, alpha, test, model and n or beta.
